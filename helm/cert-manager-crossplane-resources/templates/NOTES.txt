AWS Resources:
-------------
An IAM Role has been created with the necessary permissions for Route53 DNS validation.

To use this with cert-manager, make sure to configure your cert-manager Issuer/ClusterIssuer
with the following Route53 solver configuration:

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt
spec:
  acme:
    # ... other configurations ...
    solvers:
    - dns01:
        route53:
          region: {{ .Values.providers.aws.region }}
          role: arn:{{ .Values.providers.aws.partition }}:iam::{{ .Values.providers.aws.accountID }}:role/{{ .Values.clusterName }}-cert-manager
{{- end }}

{{- if .Values.providers.azure.enabled }}
Azure Resources:
----------------
The following Azure resources have been created:
- User Assigned Identity: {{ .Values.clusterName }}-cert-manager
- Role Assignment with DNS Zone Contributor role

{{- if .Values.providers.azure.workloadIdentity.enabled }}
- Federated Identity Credential for workload identity

To use this identity with cert-manager, make sure to configure your cert-manager Issuer/ClusterIssuer
with the following Azure DNS solver configuration:

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt
spec:
  acme:
    # ... other configurations ...
    solvers:
    - dns01:
        azureDNS:
          subscriptionID: {{ .Values.providers.azure.subscriptionId }}
          resourceGroupName: YOUR_DNS_ZONE_RESOURCE_GROUP
          hostedZoneName: YOUR_DNS_ZONE_NAME
          # When using workload identity:
          managedIdentity:
            clientID: ${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}  # This should be set in cert-manager's environment
{{- else }}
To use this identity with cert-manager, you will need to configure additional authentication
methods such as service principal credentials or managed identity.
